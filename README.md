## Description

This project focuses on analyzing the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival. It leverages data analysis techniques and machine learning models to understand the factors that influenced survival rates.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshots if applicable -->

## Features

*   Data analysis of the Titanic dataset.
*   Prediction of passenger survival based on various features.
*   Jupyter Notebook implementation for reproducible analysis.

## Tech Stack

*   Jupyter Notebook
*   Python (implied through Jupyter Notebook usage)
*   Data analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy - implied by project type)
*   Machine learning libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn - implied by project type)
